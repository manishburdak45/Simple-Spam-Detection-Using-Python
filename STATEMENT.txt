Project Title: Spam Email/SMS Classifier Using Python and Machine Learning

Declaration:
I declare that this project is my own work. The code and explanation are prepared by me for learning purpose. 
Wherever I used any reference or sample, I have tried to understand it first and then write it in my own words. 
I follow the rules of academic honesty and I have not copied the project directly from any source.

Project Summary:
This project is about identifying whether a message is “Spam” or “Ham” (Not Spam).  
The program uses a dataset of messages and applies simple machine learning techniques to classify them.

Steps done in this project:
1. Loaded the dataset (CSV file). If no file is present, the program uses a small sample dataset.
2. Cleaned the data and converted the text messages into numerical form using TF-IDF.
3. Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, which works well for text classification.
4. Evaluated the model by checking accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
5. Tested the model on new example messages and saved the model using joblib.

How to Run the Project:
1. Install the required libraries:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
2. Run the script:
   python spam_classifier.py
3. If you want, you can also add your own dataset named spam_data.csv.
