1. Declaration

I, Manish Burdak, declare that the project titled *“Spam Email/SMS Classifier using Python and Machine Learning”* is my own work.  
I have prepared this project for my academic learning and practical understanding of text classification.  
The code and explanation written in this project are done by me, and wherever any reference was used, I have tried to understand it properly before writing it in my own words.

I fully understand the rules of academic honesty and plagiarism.  
This project is created only for educational purposes, and no part of it has been copied directly from any online source or another student’s work.


2. Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to classify text messages into two categories:
Spam  
Ham (Not Spam)

For this, I have used Python and basic machine learning techniques.  
The main concept of the project is to take raw text messages, process them, and use a trained model to predict whether the message is harmful junk content (spam) or a normal message.

This project helped me understand how machine learning can be applied in real-life tasks such as email filtering, SMS blocking, and secure communication.


3. Learning Objective

The main learning objectives of this project are:
- Understanding how to clean and preprocess text data
- Learning how TF-IDF converts text into numeric vectors
- Understanding Naive Bayes classification
- Learning how to train, test, and evaluate a machine learning model
- Understanding accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Learning how to predict new messages using a trained model

These objectives helped me build a strong base in machine learning and natural language processing.


4. Tools and Technologies Used

The following tools and technologies were used in this project:
Python programming language  
Pandas (for data handling)  
Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)  
TF-IDF Vectorizer  
Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier  
Joblib (for saving the model)  
VS Code IDE (for writing and running the code)

These tools helped in building a clean and simple machine learning workflow.


5. Methodology / Steps Followed

The project followed the below steps:

1. Loading the dataset (spam_data.csv)  
2. Handling missing data and cleaning labels  
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
4. Converting messages into TF-IDF numeric vectors  
5. Training the Naive Bayes classifier  
6. Evaluating the model with accuracy and classification report  
7. Predicting new messages  
8. Saving the trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer  
9. Testing the model with custom examples  

These steps represent a complete machine learning pipeline.


6. Results and Discussion

After training the model, I tested it on the test data.  
The model showed good accuracy depending on the dataset used.  
The confusion matrix also showed that the classifier was able to correctly identify most spam and ham messages.  
The project demonstrates that even simple models like Naive Bayes work well for text classification.

I also tested some new messages like:  
- “Congratulations! You won a free phone!” → SPAM  
- “Hey bro, what’s up?” → HAM  

The model gave correct predictions and showed useful results.


7. Conclusion

This project was very helpful for understanding the basics of machine learning, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
I learned how real-world problems like spam filtering are solved using simple algorithms.  
Working on this project increased my confidence in Python, data preprocessing, and ML model building.

The project can be improved by using a bigger dataset, adding more text cleaning techniques, or using more advanced algorithms like Logistic Regression or SVM.
